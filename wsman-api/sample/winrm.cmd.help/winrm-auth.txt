Windows Remote Management Command Line Tool

winrm OPERATION -remote:VALUE 
  [-authentication:VALUE] 
  [-username:USERNAME] 
  [-password:PASSWORD]
  [-certificate:THUMBPRINT]

When connecting remotely, you can specify which credentials and which
authentication mechanisms to use.  If none are specified the current 
logged-on user's credentials will be used.

-a[uthentication]:VALUE
-----------------------
Specifies authentication mechanism used when communicating with remote machine.
Possible options are None, Basic, Digest, Negotiate, Kerberos, CredSSP.
Examples:
  -a:None
  -a:Basic
  -a:Digest
  -a:Negotiate
  -a:Kerberos
  -a:Certificate
  -a:CredSSP
Note: If an authentication mechanism is not specified, Kerberos is used unless
      one of the conditions below is true, in which case Negotiate is used:
   -explicit credentials are supplied and the destination host is trusted
   -the destination host is "localhost", "127.0.0.1" or "[::1]"
   -the client computer is in workgroup and the destination host is trusted
Note: Not all authentication mechanisms are enabled by default.  Allowed
      authentication mechanisms can be controlled by local configuration 
      or group policy.
Note: Most operations will require an authentication mode other than None.
Note: Certificate authentication can be used only with the HTTPS transport.
      To configure an HTTPS listener for the WinRM service run the command:
      "winrm quickconfig -transport:HTTPS"

-u[sername]:USERNAME
--------------------
Specifies username on remote machine. Cannot be used on local machine.
User must be member of local Administrators group on remote machine.
If the user account is a local account on the remote machine,
the syntax should be in the form -username:USERNAME
If the username is a domain account, the syntax should be in the form
-username:DOMAIN\USERNAME
If Basic or Digest is used, then -username is required.
If Kerberos is used, then the current logged-on user's credentials
are used if -username is not supplied. Only domain credentials can
be used with Kerberos.
If Negotiate is used, then -username is required unless
one of the conditions below is true:
   -the destination host is "localhost", "127.0.0.1" or "[::1]"
   -the client computer is in workgroup and the destination host is trusted
If CredSSP is used, then username and password are required.

-p[assword]:PASSWORD
--------------------
Specifies password on command line to override interactive prompt.
Applies only if -username:USERNAME option is used.

-c[ertificate]:THUMBPRINT
--------------------
Specifies the thumbprint of a certificate that must exist in the local
machine store or in the current user store. The certificate must be intended
for client authentication.
Applies only if -a:Certificate is used.
THUMBPRINT can contain spaces, in which case it must be enclosed in
double quotation marks.
Examples:
-c:7b0cf48026409e38a2d6348761b1dd1271c4f86d
-c:"7b 0c f4 80 26 40 9e 38 a2 d6 34 87 61 b1 dd 12 71 c4 f8 6d"
